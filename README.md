Example usage of:
Shadow DOM 
Declarative Shadow DOM

Tested oEmbed Drupal content to another CMS. Tested with Es6 module media gallery.

Shadow DOM requires some JS updates but Declarative Shadow DOM very easy to set up and use. Declarative Shadow DOM renders on server it is much more efficient and the page view source is available, which might be a concern with shadow DOM for SEO.

Useful if the embeded html have its own css and js and you don't want it to obstruct other sections of your page. You could also achieve this with iframe but if you need an alternative solution this works well!
