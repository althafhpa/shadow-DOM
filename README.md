Example usage of:
Shadow DOM 
Declarative Shadow DOM

Worked perfectly to oEmbed Drupal content to another CMS. Tested with media gallery and worked well. 

Shadow DOM bit of JS modifications required but Declarative Shadow DOM very easy to set up and use. Since it renders on server it is much more efficient and also the page view source is available,
which might be a concern with shadow DOM for SEO.
